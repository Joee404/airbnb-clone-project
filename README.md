- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and improving application performance.
- **Database Optimizations**:
  - **Indexing**: Speeds up queries for frequently accessed fields.
  - **Caching**: Reduces database load and improves response times.

### 🔹 Asynchronous Processing
- **Celery**: Handles background tasks such as sending booking confirmations, processing payments, and sending notifications.
- **Redis (as broker/queue)**: Supports Celery for managing and processing asynchronous jobs.

### 🔹 Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker**: Provides containerized environments for consistent development, testing, and deployment across different systems.
