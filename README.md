## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The project uses a modern and scalable technology stack:

### Backend
- **Django**: Python web framework for backend logic.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and authentication.
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query mechanism to fetch specific data.

### Database & Data Management
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
- **Redis**: In-memory datastore for caching and session management.
- **Optimizations**:
  - Indexing for faster queries.
  - Caching to reduce database load.

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Celery**: Handles background tasks like sending notifications and processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used as a message broker/queue for Celery.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment across environments.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**: Automates testing and deployment.

## 🗄️ Database Design

The database schema supports all core Airbnb-like functionalities.

### Entities & Key Fields
- **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
- **Properties**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`
- **Bookings**: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
- **Reviews**: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payments**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`

### Relationships
- A **User (host)** can list multiple properties.  
- A **User (guest)** can make multiple bookings.  
- A **Property** can have many bookings and reviews.  
- A **Booking** is linked to a **Payment**.

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

### 🔹 User Management
Users can register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. Supports both **guests** and **hosts**.

### 🔹 Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings. Guests can browse and search for available accommodations.

### 🔹 Booking System
Guests can book properties with check-in and check-out dates. Hosts can manage reservations, with availability updated automatically.

### 🔹 Payment Processing
Handles secure booking transactions via trusted payment gateways.

### 🔹 Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in, promoting trust and transparency.

### 🔹 API Documentation
APIs are documented with the **OpenAPI standard** and support both REST (DRF) and **GraphQL**.

### 🔹 Database Optimizations
Indexing and caching improve query performance and responsiveness.

## 🔒 API Security

Security is a core priority for protecting user data and financial transactions.

- **Authentication**: Token-based (JWT) to ensure only verified users access APIs.  
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for guests, hosts, and admins.  
- **Data Protection**: 
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt.  
  - HTTPS/TLS for all communication.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
- **Secure Payments**: Processed via PCI DSS-compliant third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses automated pipelines for reliable integration and deployment.

### What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Runs tests, linting, and builds whenever code is pushed.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys to staging/production after successful tests.  

### Why It Matters
- **Reliability:** Ensures new features don’t break existing functionality.  
- **Faster Delivery:** Reduces manual deployment steps.  
- **Consistency:** Guarantees reproducible builds across environments.  
- **Scalability:** Supports multiple developers working in parallel.  

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates build, test, and deploy workflows.  
- **Docker**: Provides portable and consistent environments.  
- **(Optional) Kubernetes**: For orchestration and scalability in production.
