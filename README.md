### 🔹 Entity Relationships
- **User ↔ Properties**: A user (host) can list multiple properties, but each property belongs to one host.  
- **User ↔ Bookings**: A user (guest) can make multiple bookings; each booking belongs to one user.  
- **Property ↔ Bookings**: A property can have many bookings; each booking is linked to one property.  
- **Property ↔ Reviews**: A property can have many reviews; each review belongs to one property and is written by one user.  
- **Booking ↔ Payments**: Each booking has one associated payment record.

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone includes several core features that replicate the essential functionality of the Airbnb platform. Each feature is designed to provide a seamless experience for users and hosts, while ensuring scalability and reliability for the system.

### 🔹 User Management
Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature supports both **guests** (who book properties) and **hosts** (who list properties), providing secure authentication and role-based access.

### 🔹 Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. Properties include details such as title, location, price per night, and availability, enabling guests to browse and search for accommodations.

### 🔹 Booking System
Provides the ability for guests to book properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. Hosts can manage reservations, and the system ensures that availability is updated to prevent conflicts or double-bookings.

### 🔹 Payment Processing
Handles secure transactions related to bookings. Guests can pay for reservations, and payment records are linked to bookings for financial tracking and reporting.

### 🔹 Review System
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. This promotes trust and transparency by helping future guests make informed decisions based on previous experiences.

### 🔹 API Documentation
The backend APIs are documented using the **OpenAPI standard**, ensuring clarity for developers integrating with the system. Both RESTful endpoints (via Django REST Framework) and **GraphQL queries** are supported for flexibility.

### 🔹 Database Optimizations
Implements performance improvements such as **indexing** for fast query execution and **caching** with Redis to reduce database load. These optimizations enhance the responsiveness and scalability of the application.

## 🔒 API Security

Security is a top priority for the Airbnb Clone project to protect user data, ensure safe transactions, and maintain trust. The following security measures will be implemented across the backend APIs:

### 🔹 Authentication
- **What it is:** Verifies the identity of users before granting access to the system.
- **Implementation:** Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) will be used to ensure that only verified users can interact with the APIs.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only registered users can book properties, post reviews, or manage listings.

### 🔹 Authorization
- **What it is:** Determines what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.
- **Implementation:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between guests, hosts, and administrators.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures that users can only perform actions permitted by their role, such as preventing guests from modifying other users’ properties.

### 🔹 Data Protection
- **What it is:** Safeguarding sensitive information such as passwords and payment details.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Passwords stored using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).  
  - Encrypted communication via HTTPS/TLS for all API requests.  
- **Why it matters:** Protects users’ personal data and financial information from exposure or theft.

### 🔹 Rate Limiting
- **What it is:** Restricting the number of API requests a user can make in a given timeframe.
- **Implementation:** API gateway or middleware-based rate limiting to mitigate abuse.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and protects system resources from being overloaded.

### 🔹 Input Validation & Sanitization
- **What it is:** Ensuring that data received through APIs is safe and valid.
- **Implementation:** Validate all user inputs and sanitize queries to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Why it matters:** Prevents malicious input from compromising the system or corrupting data.

### 🔹 Secure Payments
- **What it is:** Protecting financial transactions.
- **Implementation:** Integration with trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that comply with PCI DSS standards.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures that sensitive payment details are never directly handled or stored by the application, reducing risk of fraud or data breaches.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are an essential part of modern software development. They automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring faster delivery and higher software quality.

### 🔹 What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Every time code is pushed to the repository, automated workflows run tests, linting, and builds to ensure the new code integrates smoothly with the existing system.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** After successful testing, the code is automatically deployed to staging or production environments, reducing manual effort and deployment risks.

### 🔹 Why CI/CD is Important for This Project
- **Reliability:** Ensures new features don’t break existing functionality by running automated tests.
- **Faster Delivery:** Reduces manual steps, enabling quicker releases of new features and bug fixes.
- **Consistency:** Guarantees that deployments are reproducible and stable across environments.
- **Scalability:** Supports the team in working collaboratively with fewer integration issues.

### 🔹 Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application directly from GitHub.
- **Docker:** Provides containerized environments to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production.
- **(Optional) Kubernetes:** Can be used to orchestrate Docker containers for scaling and high availability.
- **CI/CD Best Practices:** Include automated testing, code linting, environment variables for secrets, and rollback strategies.
